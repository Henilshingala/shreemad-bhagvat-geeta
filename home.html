            <h2>About Shreemad Bhagavad Gita</h2>
            <p>The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It is a conversation between the prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. The dialogue takes place on the battlefield just before the start of a great war, where Arjuna is filled with doubt and moral dilemma about fighting in the battle.

                The Bhagavad Gita covers various aspects of life, philosophy, and spirituality, offering guidance on duty (dharma), righteousness, and the nature of reality. It discusses different paths to spiritual realization, including karma yoga (the path of selfless action), bhakti yoga (the path of devotion), and jnana yoga (the path of knowledge). 
                
                One of the central teachings of the Bhagavad Gita is the concept of performing one's duty without attachment to the results, emphasizing the importance of action over inaction and detachment from the fruits of one's actions.
                
                The Bhagavad Gita has been highly revered by Hindus for centuries and has also gained recognition worldwide for its profound philosophical insights and spiritual teachings. It has been studied and commented upon by numerous scholars and has inspired countless individuals in their spiritual journey.</p>
